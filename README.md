# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
## Context
Credit card companies must be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
## Dataset
The data was downloaded from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
## Goal
Using a machine learning model, the objective is to classify the data transactions as either legitimate (class 0) or fraudulent (class 1). Three machine learning models will be trained and tested to determine which will yield the best results:

-Decision Trees
-Random Forest
K Means Clustering
